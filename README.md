## Introduction

The Presenter Evaluation Project is developed to evaluate presenters during their presentations or public speaking engagements. The project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze various aspects of the presenter's performance and provide feedback.

The system focuses on four key metrics:

1. Eye contact: Evaluates the presenter's ability to establish and maintain eye contact with the audience. It measures the frequency and duration of eye contact with the audience members.

2. Body movement: Assesses the presenter's use of body language and movement to engage the audience. It analyzes the presenter's posture, gestures, and overall body language.

3. Hand movement: Examines the presenter's hand gestures and movements. It identifies the types and frequency of hand movements used during the presentation.

4. Facial expressions: Evaluates the presenter's facial expressions and emotions conveyed during the presentation. It detects and analyzes various facial expressions to assess the presenter's level of engagement and expression.

## Metrics

### Eye Contact

The eye contact metric measures the presenter's ability to establish and maintain eye contact with the audience. It evaluates the following aspects:

- Frequency of eye contact: How often the presenter makes eye contact with the audience.
- Duration of eye contact: The length of time the presenter maintains eye contact with individual audience members.

### Body Movement

The body movement metric assesses the presenter's use of body language and movement to engage the audience. It evaluates the following aspects:

- Posture: The presenter's overall body posture during the presentation.
- Gestures: The types and effectiveness of hand and arm gestures used.
- Overall movement: The presenter's movement across the stage or presentation area.

### Hand Movement

The hand movement metric examines the presenter's use of hand gestures and movements. It evaluates the following aspects:

- Types of hand gestures: The variety and effectiveness of hand gestures used.
- Frequency of hand movements: How often the presenter uses hand movements during the presentation.

### Facial Expressions

The facial expressions metric evaluates the presenter's facial expressions and emotions conveyed during the presentation. It assesses the following aspects:

- Expressiveness: The presenter's ability to convey emotions and engagement through facial expressions.
- Variety of expressions: The range and diversity of facial expressions displayed during the presentation.
